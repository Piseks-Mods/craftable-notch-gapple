# Pisek's Craftable Enchanted Golden Apple

During the `1.9` development, the Notch Apple was made uncraftable, obtainable only by exploring. With this data pack, I bring back the recipe, but in a different way. Instead of crafting it using Gold Blocks and Apple in Crafting, you must combine Golden Apple and Netherite Ingot in Smithing Table. With this Netherite have another use instead of upgrading your armor.
